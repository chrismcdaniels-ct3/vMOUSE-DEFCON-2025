# AWS Amplify Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the Unity WebGL Platform to AWS Amplify.

## Prerequisites

1. AWS Account with Amplify access
2. GitHub repository connected (already done: chrismcdaniels-ct3/vMOUSE-DEFCON-2025)
3. S3 bucket with Unity files (already set up: ct3-unity-webgl-assets)

## Amplify Setup Steps

### 1. Create New Amplify App

1. Go to AWS Amplify Console
2. Click "New app" â†’ "Host web app"
3. Choose "GitHub" as the source provider
4. Authorize GitHub and select the repository: `chrismcdaniels-ct3/vMOUSE-DEFCON-2025`
5. Select branch: `main`

### 2. Configure Build Settings

Amplify will auto-detect the Next.js app and use the `amplify.yml` file in the repository.

### 3. Environment Variables

Add these environment variables in Amplify Console:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
NEXT_PUBLIC_UNITY_USE_S3=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_UNITY_S3_BUCKET=ct3-unity-webgl-assets
NEXT_PUBLIC_UNITY_S3_REGION=us-east-1
NEXT_PUBLIC_UNITY_BASE_URL=https://ct3-unity-webgl-assets.s3.amazonaws.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
```

### 4. Deploy

1. Review settings and click "Save and deploy"
2. Amplify will build and deploy the application
3. Access your app at the provided Amplify URL

## Build Configuration

The `amplify.yml` file is configured to:
- Use pnpm for package management
- Build Next.js in standalone mode
- Copy necessary static files
- Set up proper caching

## Important Notes

- Unity files are served from S3, not from the repository
- The app uses Next.js 15 with standalone output
- CORS is configured on the S3 bucket for Unity file access

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
- Check Amplify build logs
- Ensure all environment variables are set
- Verify Node.js version compatibility (requires 18+)

### Unity Loading Issues
- Verify S3 bucket is accessible
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Ensure S3 bucket policy allows public reads

### Performance
- Consider setting up CloudFront for S3 files
- Enable Amplify's performance mode
- Use the built-in caching strategies
